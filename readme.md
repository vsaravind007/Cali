What is it?
-------------
Microsoft Windows users are familiar with the calendar widget that pops up when the date/time on the task bar is clicked. Coming from the Windows background, I found the absence of a simple calendar widget in Mac OSX, too disturbing! Hence Cali was born. Cali is an opensource calendar widget that runs on the menu bar. It is based on Atom Electron HTML5 cross platform application framework and Menubar plugin.

 **Building**

```
npm install
npm run build
```
 
 **Dependencies**
 Built using Electron & Menubar app plugin for Electron.
